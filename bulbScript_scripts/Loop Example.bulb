//Example of a "for loop" using functions

var i

func loop //Start of function

if i < 11 //Start of if statement
    add i 1 //This function will keep recursively calling itself and adding 1 to i for as long as i is less than 11
    call loop
end if //End of if statement

end func //End of function

set i 0 
call loop //Calls the loop function
